What is Setup?
-------------
Setup is a small, lightweight project to speed up the initial work to rock a new project.
It comes with a basic build process via Grunt (npm based), Typescript and SCSS to provide
a modern web.
You should be focused on your new great stuff, not to think about the right project structure.

I would love to hear your thoughts!

How to setup Setup?
------------------
There are a few thinks, you have to do:

- install NPM
- create a new folder
- paste the content of this repo into this folder
- change the project name from "Setup" to your project name in typings.json and package.json
- go to your project path with cmd
- type "npm install" and push return

ThatÂ´s it, Setup is now installed. Should not take more than 2 minutes.

How to work with Setup?
-------
- You could use every markup language or create dynamic content.
- just include your compiled js files and the main.css from assets/prod/[styles/scripts]
- start the grunt watchers or build manually
- make your work on your style




Have fun! Create wonderful things!
